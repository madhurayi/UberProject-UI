# `GO RIDE - A Cab Booking Application`

A modern ride-sharing platform where drivers can manage ride requests in real-time and users can book rides seamlessly. Built with React TypeScript frontend and Spring Boot backend with real-time WebSocket communication.

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: React.js (Passenger and Driver Portal)
- **Backend**:
  - **API Gateway**: Central entrypoint
  - **Auth Service**: Login/Registration
  - **Booking Service**: Booking creation, ride tracking
  - **Location Service**: Handles nearby drivers using Redis
  - **Socket Service**: WebSocket-based real-time communication
  - **Redis**: Stores online driver data (location + vehicle type)
  - **Service Discovery**: Eureka/Consul for service registration

## üö¶ Workflow

### Passenger Flow:
1. Logs in via API Gateway ‚Üí Auth Service
2. Redirects to Booking Page
3. Enters pickup/drop + vehicle type ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Booking Service
4. Booking Service:
   - Saves data to DB
   - Calls Location Service to fetch nearby drivers from Redis
   - Calls Socket Service to send ride request to those drivers
5. If a driver accepts, continuous updates are sent via WebSocket.

### Driver Flow:
1. Logs in ‚Üí redirected to Driver Portal
2. Goes Online ‚Üí Sends location via WebSocket to Socket Service
3. Socket Service calls Location Service ‚Üí Saves driver in Redis
4. When a nearby booking is made, ride requests are pushed to drivers.
5. On acceptance, Socket Service notifies Booking Service + Passenger.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- React.js (frontend)
- Spring Boot (backend microservices)
- Redis
- WebSocket (STOMP over SockJS)
- Eureka for service discovery
- API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)

---

## üß™ Local Setup

1. Start `service-discovery`
2. Start all services (auth, booking, location, socket)
3. Start `api-gateway`
4. Start frontend (`npm start`)
5. Ensure Redis is running

---

## üîê Authentication

- Role-based: Passenger, Driver
- JWT included with user role, used for securing backend endpoints

---

## üì¨ Real-time Communication

- WebSocket endpoints handled by `socket-service`
- Passenger receives real-time driver responses
- Drivers receive ride requests based on Redis-filtered proximity

---

## üìå Future Enhancements

- Payment Integration
- Rating & Review system
- Driver analytics dashboard
